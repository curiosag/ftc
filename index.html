      Get a quick start with Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/sql-reference">fusion tables sql</a>. Use code completion and context sensitive sql snippets with table or column parameters. Refer to tables by name or ID. Keep things in perspective with syntax highlighting covering syntactic and semantic errors. Delete, rename and copy tables by sql.

<h3>Get started</h3>
You need <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables">some fusion tables you own</a> or some <a href="https://research.google.com/tables?hl=en&ei=xYqhVpuCJsHipQOqzLiIDw&corpus=fusion&q=dog">external table IDs</a>, a <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">google developers project</a> with <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis"> activated fusion tables api</a> and an <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials"><a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials">OAuth2 client ID</a></a> (with application type "other") for the project. </small>
<p></p>Download the packaged JAR archive, extract it, run ftc.bat (Windows), ftc.sh (make sure it is executable) for unix-like systems or "java -jar ftcClientJava-0.1.jar" otherwise. Requires Java 7.

<p></p>Enter client id and secret, then press  <img src="authButton.gif" alt="authenticate">. The authentication workflow will try to open your default browser and take you through further steps. If it doesen't show up, you can find the required URL in the log pane, proceed manually in this case. If anything goes wrong with the authentication, the client waits for the defined timeout period and then cancels. In case of success the client stores the credentials and authenticates automatically in future sessions.
        <p></p>Once authenticated press ctrl+space in the empty editor window for a list of top level sql statements.
<p></p>
<h3>Covers</h3>
        <p></p>
      SELECT, CREATE VIEW, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DESCRIBE and SHOW TABLES, well ... everything.
<p></p>
For tables owned by yourself you can use table names instead of table IDs. Make sure, there are no naming collisions. This also was the reason to start the project in the first place. I have a limited capacity to memorize random sequences of 40 characters, but I'm also working on this issue with Derren Brown. The app was the quick fix, though.

      <h3>Extended commands</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>Syntax</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rename table</td><td>ALTER TABLE [table name or ID] RENAME TO [new name]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delete table</td><td>DROP TABLE  [table name or ID]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Copy table</td><td>CREATE TABLE [table name] AS SELECT * FROM [source table name or ID] </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<table>

<tr><td>F5</td><td>Execute query</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+F5</td><td>Cancel query execution</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alt+F5</td><td>View preprocessed query</td></tr>

<tr><td>Ctrl+F</td><td>Focus editor text field</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+space</td><td>Trigger code completion. Switch between proposed sql snippets and table or column names</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alt+left</td><td>Browse command history backwards</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alt+right</td><td>Browse command history forward</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alt+M</td><td>Memorize editor text ... means, append it to the command history without executing the query</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+T</td><td>Show tables</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+E</td><td>Export to csv file</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+S</td><td>Save editor text ... a bit of an overkill, as you can only use a single statement per execution anyway. On the other hand: who knows, maybe somebody uses it to write a novel or whatever</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+O</td><td>Open file</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
        	 <li>Column ids can be used in queries, but they are not covered by semantic highlighting, so you get a blue wiggle line for them</li>
        	 <li>If a table has an alias, the alias must always be preceded by the keyword "AS"</li>
        	 <li>Handling of huge amounts of data isn't the goal of the implementation. On the other hand, it may take you as far as the computer's memory allows it to.</li>
			 <li>I guess the snippet aproach to sql ran into its limits with the create view statement using joins</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Things to come, maybe</h3>
        <ul>
			 <li>A command line interface. Every application should have one</li>
			 <li>A repository of external table IDs with associated names readable by humans</li>
        	 <li>Support multiple queries in the editor, with sequential execution and multiple files/tab sheets</li>
        	 <li>Full SELECT clause in CREATE TABLE statement</li>
        	 <li>Allow WHERE clause in CREATE VIEW statement with JOIN clause</li>
			 <li>And all the rest like import, export and stuff</li>
			 <li>Extend functionality by procedural and functional constructs and connectors to every data store known to man with a query language</li>
			 <li>A GUI that actually looks cool</li>
			 <li>Market the thing</li>
			 <li>Hire Andrew Ng and pack in deep machine learning until the thing knows what you want to do before you know it yourself and then does it for you (meaning outpace Google). Hire Derren Brown and make the thing capable of convincing you within the blink of an eye, that what it did is actually what you wanted, no matter, what it did or what you wanted in the first place (outpace everybody and everything everywhere)</li>
			 <li>The IPO</li>
			 <li>Add every functionality possible</li>
			 <li>Buy Oracle</li>
			 <li>Fire Larry Ellison</li>
			 <li>Mount a towing hitch to my Ferrari and test its performance when pulling trailers. Maybe hire Larry Ellison again and delegate this task to him</li>
			 <li>Buy Google</li>
			 <li>Buy everything, gift it to the worst team in the soccer league and retire as a hermit</li>
        </ul>
